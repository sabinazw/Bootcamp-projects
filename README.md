# Various Bootcamp Projects

You will find here my few programs created during Software Engineering Bootcamp with HyperionDev.




## 1. String Handling - alternative.py

● This is a program that reads in a string and makes each alternate
character into an upper case character and each other alternate character a lower case character. e.g. The string “Hello World” would become “HeLlO WoRlD”

● Now, starting with the same string but making each alternative word
lower and upper case.
e.g. The string: “I am learning to code” would become “i AM learning
TO code”.
## 2. Variables and Control Structures - finance_calculators.py

This program allows the user to access two different financial calculators: an investment calculator and a home loan repayment calculator.
## 3. Control Structures - For Loop - pattern1.py
This is a code that generates the star pattern.
## 4. IO Operations - Output - student_register.py

This program allows a user to register students for an exam venue.

## 5. User-defined Functions - holiday.py

This program will calculate a user’s total holiday cost, which includes the plane cost, hotel cost, and car-rental cost.
